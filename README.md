# Butterflies Demo
## Using ThreeJs and React Three Fiber
Based on Reece Sugars' [youtube tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hm2osohQ9U&t=349s) and [Git Hub](https://github.com/lilsugsy/butterfly-effect-landing-page/tree/main)

The purpose of this tutorial is to get accustomed to building ThreeJS projects in React with React Three Fiber. I found this tutorial on a youtube search and really like what Reece made.
